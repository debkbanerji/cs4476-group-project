                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    When people shop for clothing items online, it is often hard for them to tell how well an item of clothing will fit on themselves. Oftentimes, the model that is used to display the clothing item represents an “idea” physique for that article of clothing, making it difficult for the user to image how the item will fit on their own physique. There have been attempts to solve this problem by attempting to “fit” the image of the clothing item onto an image or 3D model of the user. These attempts have shown success but require complex 3D models [1] or an expensive camera setup that will track the user’s pose and physique [2]. Our solution attempts to remove the cost and complexity of fitting a clothing item to the user’s body while still giving an accurate representation of how an article of clothing will fit onto the user. The Seam Team presents a method that allows user to take an image of a piece of clothing and overlay it onto an image of themselves so they can have a realistic idea of how something fits before making a purchase.

                <h3> Collecting Correspondence Points</h3>
                <p>
                    To be able to transform the image of the t-shirt onto the image of the user, we need to collect correspondence information between common points on the t-shirt image and on the user’s body. Our system first requests an image of the user in the predefined pose we outlined in our project proposal. The user is then asked to select points on their own image that correspond to the left sleeve of a short-sleeved t-shirt. We decided to store correspondence points for the sleeves and the torso separately so we can easily differentiate between sleeve correspondences and torso correspondences. The user is then asked to select points corresponding to their right sleeve and then their torso. This process is then repeated on an image of a t-shirt that the user wants to try on. When the user is done selecting these points, we now have a set of corresponding points that can later be used for a homography transformation.
                </p>

                <h3> Seam Carving </h3>
                <p>
                    One of the major problems that we wanted to address with our system is distortion caused by warping a piece of clothing onto the target wearer. This warping leads to unnatural distortion which is especially noticeable in the context of the image as a whole. For example, if a t-shirt of certain proportions is warped to fit a relatively tall and thin wearer, the homography transformation would warp the original image in a way that would cause noticeable distortion during stretching.

                <h3>Experiment and Results</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>In the implementation of this project, we will utilize code that calculates the homography matrix
                    to map the shirt onto the figure’s body. However, before this mapping can be completed we will need
                    to analyze the image to assess whether or not the image must be shrunk or expanded in horizontal and
                    vertical directions. In this modification of the image, we will need to use a modified version of
                    the seam carving algorithm that utilizes a specific heuristic such that the clothing is modified in
                    a realistic fashion. This will require extensive testing and parameter tweaking in the calculation
                    of the energy function within the shirts. We hope to design an energy function that will not only be
                    suitable for seam carving, but also be able to account for how fully the item encompasses the user.
                    Additionally, for cases of sub-optimal lighting of the figure, we will need to find a way to analyze
                    the image and apply filters so that the result of the overlay looks natural. Since our system will be
                    the one applying the shirt onto the target image, we will be able to identify depth discontinuity caused
                    by the edges of the object (without accidentally detecting other edges) and use this information as a heuristic
                    to add more realistic lighting to the image.</p>
                <p>To test the homography matrices that we generate for a figure and a given clothing item, we wish to
                    test various lighting scenarios on both the image of the figure and the image of the clothing item.
                    To establish consistency, we will establish a specific pose for individuals to follow when they take
                    images of themselves. To start off, we hope to be able to map t-shirts onto both male and female
                    models.</p>

                    valid images of clothing items to test on. Additionally, we will be using a mixed variety of models
                    also picked off of retail websites to try overlaying the clothing on top of as well as actual images
                    taken from smartphones of students/friends that consent to being included in this project.</p>

                <h4>Testing Our Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    A successful solution would be an image of a clothing item overlayed on a user's figure such that
                    the result
                    looks "natural". We define "natural" to satisfy the following constraints:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of image distortion shirt</li>
                    <li>Lack of artifacts</li>
                    <li>Proper alignment of shirt on body</li>
                    <li>Lack of mismatched lighting</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To test the results of our mapping, we will examine the following variations in the images:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Different lighting conditions of the image of the user posing</b></p>
                        By testing lighting conditions, we will be able to assess how we much manipulate the image of
                        the user so that the shirt that is overlaid on their body looks natural. For example, if an
                        image is in dark lighting, but the clothing item is very bright there will be a very obvious
                        discrepancy
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Varying resolutions of the shirt/clothing item and of the image of the user posing
                        </b></p>
                        If the resolution of the shirt is significantly larger or smaller than the resolution of the
                        figure then there will need to be scaling done before any homographies can be completed.
                        Additionally, there will need to be a threshold in which the algorithm we create decides that
                        seam carving is a more proper solution to increasing the dimensions of the clothing item because
                        scaling would be an unrealistic representation of the shirt. We will need to test various
                        resolutions to best accommodate these conditions and figure out what the “sweet spot” threshold
                        will be.

                            matrix</b></p>
                        Because user input is required, we need to limit the number of clicks required because otherwise
                        the user will not believe that using this tool is worth their time. Therefore we need to try to
                        figure out the minimum number of points on that are strictly necessary for the user to identify
                        in order for the mapping to work effectively. We expect that shoulder, end of sleeves, and hips
                        will definitely be necessary, but are currently unsure about how the collar of the shirt will be
                        accounted for, and how the requirements might change if the clothing item is a long-sleeved
                        shirt.
